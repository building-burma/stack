# Non-tech Tech Stack for Effective Business Ops
Non-tech Tech Stack<br>

[Claude AI](https://claude.ai/login)
LLM that allows large pdf uploads. After uploading, you can ask the LLM questions about the pdf documents.<br>

[Metaphor AI](https://metaphor.systems/)
LLM-wrapper that enhances search capability. From experience using the product, it seems to produce better search results for scientific papers compared to Google Scholar. Can also bring up highly-related links in search results that do not show up in Google search.<br>

[Perplexity AI](https://www.perplexity.ai/)
Another LLM-wrapper that works like Metaphor and can be used as a backup service if Metaphor goes down or you run out of free credits.<br>

Note on LLM-wrappers: You can use these services for free credits, to extend free credits given by OpenAI's ChatGPT or other LLMs.<br>

[Render](https://www.render.com)
Render is a pretty good, scalable web host with a free tier for small, test projects. If the project works out, there's no need to transfer files to another host: you can simply upgrade. (Similarly, if it does not work out, the test didn't cost you anything.)<br>
